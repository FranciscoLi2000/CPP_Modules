/* Write a precursor to a menu-driven program.
 * The program should display a menu offering four choices, each labeled with a letter.
 * If the user responds with a letter other than one of the four valid choices, the program should prompt the user to enter a valid response until the user complies.
 * Then the program should use a switch to select a simple action based on the userâ€™s selection.
 * A program run could look something like this:
 * Please enter one of the following choices:
 * c) carnivore p) pianist
 * t) tree g) game
 * f
 * Please enter a c, p, t, or g: q
 * Please enter a c, p, t, or g: t
 * A maple is a tree. */

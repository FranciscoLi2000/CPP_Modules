/* You sell the book C++ for Fools.
 * Write a program that has you enter a yearâ€™s worth of monthly sales (in terms of number of books, not of money).
 * The program should use a loop to prompt you by month, using an array of char * (or an array of string objects, if you prefer) initialized to the month strings and storing the input data in an array of int.
 * Then, the program should find the sum of the array contents and report the total sales for the year. */
